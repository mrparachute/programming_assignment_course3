This is the submission for the Programming Assignment of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course from Coursera Data Science Specialization (Johns Hopkins University)

This folder contains 2 files:
- a codebook named CodeBook.md: explains the background of the analysis, the source of the data and then specify our objectives and variables used in the script.
- a R script named run_analysis.R: script used to merge and clean the train and test datasets and extract only the mean and standard deviation variables. It also summarises by combination of subject and activity the average of the variables extracted.
